- Set visibility settings on your repository
- Review the repo of another team, making direct edits for improvements:

## Overall presentation:

- travis passing, badged?
- information in readme, yaml header
- output files committed

## Rmd inspection  

- Remove extraneous / duplicate code blocks.
- Request narrative text where text is missing
- executable, top-to-bottom?

##  Understand and compare results:

- Data table strategies: joining vs separate tables
- Can the code be made more consise?
- Can the code be made more readable? 
- Handling of missing values
- Data aggregration: by stock or species?  Or species x area? How does this change the results?
- Compare stock assessment patterns (SSB) to total catch (TC)
