Read the opening sections of chapter 13 on *Strings* and working with *Regular Expressions*: Sections [14.1 - 14.3](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions).

We will also be exploring REST APIs using the [`httr` package](http://httr.r-lib.org/), which is not covered by our textbook but will be introduced in class.
