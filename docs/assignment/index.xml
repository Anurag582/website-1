      <description>Unit I: Climate Change Module Warm-up exercise: Examining CO2 trends in R  Example from http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ Raw data from ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt  Which months are the CO2 values at the maximum? Minimum? Why is this?
What rolling average is used in computing the “trend” line? How does the trend depend on the rolling average?
  Exercise I: Temperature Data Each of the last years has consecutively set new records on global climate.</description>

      <description>Attention: To get started on the exercise, visit the Piazza post to create your team repo.
In this section, we will explore population dynamics of multiple interacting species; or more generally, dynamics in multiple variables. Previously, our only dynamic variable was a single focal population, sometimes called x, or squirrels, that could change over time in response to how many other squirrels there were. All other aspects of system were fixed: such as the environmental conditions responsible for determining the growth rate r and carrying capacity K.</description>
