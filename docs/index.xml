      <description>Prerequisites You should be generally numerically literate, and some prior programming experience will be helpful. Students new to programming might find Hands on Programming with R to be helpful. Students with significant experience in programming and statistical analysis should find themselves well prepared but should find plenty still to learn in each lesson.
Instructional Methods As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video material that they are expected to view/read prior to class.</description>

      <description>Unit 3: Fisheries Collapse Module This module will focus on understanding and replicating fisheries stock assessment data and fisheries collapse. Follow along with Carl, as he live codes the first exercise and then complete the second as your group assignment.
The Database We will use data from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database
First, load in the necessary librarys. Note that this time we need a package we haven’t used before readxl.</description>

Unit I: Climate Change Module Warm-up exercise: Examining CO2 trends in R  Example from http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ Raw data from ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt  Which months are the CO2 values at the maximum? Minimum? Why is this?
What rolling average is used in computing the “trend” line? How does the trend depend on the rolling average?
  Exercise I: Temperature Data Each of the last years has consecutively set new records on global climate.</description>

      <description>Please prepare a short proposal on your final project idea for next Thursday, Nov 2. The proposal should include:
 Title &amp;amp; description of the project Your name &amp;amp; partner&amp;rsquo;s name A description of the data required, and how it will be obtained (e.g. URL/DOI to data source) 3 questions / analysis tasks you will perform on the data; in the spirit of the assignments we have been doing.  You may choose to work with your partner or independently on the final project.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that our textbook doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any section on geospatial data. Most exsiting resources on geospatial data in R still cover the older sp library, including the classic Applied Spatial Data Analysis in R (physical) textbook (by authors of sp and related packages, who are also authors of sf).
The under-development version of an upcoming textbook, Geocomputation with R, aims to provide a more thorough treatment of the latest iteration on spatial data in R, including the sf package and tidyverse-style programming.</description>

      <description>Attention: To get started on the exercise, visit the Piazza post to create your team repo.
In this section, we will explore population dynamics of multiple interacting species; or more generally, dynamics in multiple variables. Previously, our only dynamic variable was a single focal population, sometimes called x, or squirrels, that could change over time in response to how many other squirrels there were. All other aspects of system were fixed: such as the environmental conditions responsible for determining the growth rate r and carrying capacity K.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s class will introduce the basic idea of an R package as a fundamental unit for sharing re-usable R functions. We will re-organize our population dynamics assignment repo into the structure required for an R package.
While writing a minimal R package is really pretty simple, R packages are still considered an advanced topic and rightly the subject of completely separate books. We recommend Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s Writing R Packages which is available in press or online for more detailed reading.</description>

      <description>Install Docker (Community Edition, free &amp;amp; open source) for your laptop Launch the Docker command line, and run: docker pull rocker/tidyverse to download the image we&amp;rsquo;ll be using in class. This is a large download (689 MB), so please attempt this ahead of time since we won&amp;rsquo;t all be able to download it at once. If either of these steps do not work for you, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we should be able to fix any special cases in class.</description>

      <description>Exercise This module is inspired by a recent paper in Nature Ecology and Evolution, Mapping the global potential for marine aquaculture. The authors used multiple constraints including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, bottom depth and more, to limit and map areas suitable for aquaculture.
 We are going to use a similar, but much more simplified approach here. We will map potential areas of marine aquaculture for the super cute Pacific spiny lumpsucker (Eumicrotremus orbis)</description>
